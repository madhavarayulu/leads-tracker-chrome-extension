**What it does:**

This is a basic Chrome extension that helps you collect and store website URLs as leads.

Here's how it works:

1. **Capture URLs:**
   - You can manually add URLs by typing them into the input field and clicking the "SAVE INPUT" button.
   - Alternatively, you can quickly save the URL of the current tab by clicking the "SAVE TAB" button.

2. **Store Leads:**
   - Entered URLs are saved in your browser's local storage, allowing you to access them even after restarting your browser.

3. **View Saved Leads:**
   - All saved leads are displayed as a list of clickable links.

4. **Clear Leads:**
   - Double-clicking the "DELETE ALL" button will remove all saved leads from local storage and the list.
